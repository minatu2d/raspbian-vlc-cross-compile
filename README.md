raspbian-vlc-cross-compile
==========================

A Vagrantfile and assorted scripting to cross-compile VLC for Raspbian, based on the instructions contained in [this blog post](http://intensecode.blogspot.pt/2013/10/tutorial-vlc-with-hardware-acceleration.html).

This requires a Debian Wheezy (64-bit) box (or LXC container) and a reasonably recent version of [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com).
